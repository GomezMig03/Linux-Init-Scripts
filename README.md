# Linux Init Scripts
Scripts to automatically set your system up after a fresh install

## How to Use
Download the script for you, if you don't know which one to use, download the Basic one for your distro, then open it, either with double click if your desktop environment supports it, or in the command line using ```./``` before the name of the file, a lot of desktop environments support accessing the command line in a specific directory directly right-clicking in the file explorer and selecting the correspoding option.
For example
```
./BasicFedoraGaming.sh
```
If this doesn't work you can try using ```bash``` before the ```./```, for example
```
bash ./BasicFedoraGaming.sh
```
Make sure you are in the same directory as the file, you can see which is your current directory in the command line with ```pwd```, you can also see current directory archives with ```ls``` and move with ```cd```.

## To do
I would like to add scripts for other distros, as well as a GUI where you could select which programs to install or what tweaks to get.
